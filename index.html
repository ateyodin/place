                <h2>SPECIALTY DELIVERABLES</h2>
                <p>Please note that our firm has significant experience in developing, implementing and training users in
                 web-based documentation and user support systems.

                These web-based systems have the significant advantage of:</p>
                <p>• Little or no client-side application support, relying exclusively on standardized browsers on the desktop
                or laptop. Any authorized user can access these applications with the correct access levels by internal and
                external customers - inside or outside of the organization. </p>
                <p>• Realization of significant cost and time advantages by the customer. The speed of delivery for
                revisions and additions is greatly improved, thereby breaking the costly cycle of desktop installation
                and re-installation throughout the organization or customer base.</p>
                <p>• Retention and control of source code on the host side rather than potential exposure at the client
                desktop level.</p>
                <p> • Additional advantages are realized from on-line documentation of legacy and new systems by
                speeding troubleshooting at the Beta and/or customer support level. </p>
                <p> • Speeding the life cycle of new development initiatives or enhancements to existing systems.</p>
                <p>• Enhancing the ability to provide quick turnaround for Quality Assurance and regression testing efforts.</p>
                <p>"The continuing success of our clients' projects in meeting their needs is the benchmark of our success
                as as company."</p>
